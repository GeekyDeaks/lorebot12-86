"If they find it, can they contain it?",
"I thought? No, no!",
"Something vast is arising before us, or, are we falling towards it?",
"It is dim, but it can be wielded, shaped.",
"What ever hides in plain sight is making its own plans.",
"The Wolves are near, she is a fool to think she can control them.",
"Silence; still.",
"And silence still. Nothing but silence.",
"It's no time for questions. We must be bold!",
"Not Light, but not Darkness. Something else?",
"None are light, or, each one of them is guilty.",

"Perhaps now the vaults can be destroyed?",
"Silence still, and the Darkness moves closer.",

"There are more still out there.",
"Then they are vulnerable. Good.",
"She is powerful. But not invincible.",
"Do not stop. You must return.",
"Are you certain? Tell me where.",
"Stay away -- it is a dead zone.",
"What have you found? Oh.",
"There is still so much more ground to cover.",
"I fear so little remains.",
"No. No -- that isn't right.",
"There was nothing more you could have done.",
"You must have faith.",
"But she -- she was strong.",
"Where was this?",
