This will return a link to the card, with first 50 or so characters and image of card. If not, then no card name matched your query. The link provided will still take you to Ishtar and give suggestions based on your query.

This will, like the card method, return a link to the item or weapon along with the flavor text and an image of the item. If not, then your search did not match. Follow the link to Ishtar and check if it's suggestions match what you were looking for.
